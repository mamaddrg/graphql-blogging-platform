# GraphQL Blogging Platform

A simple **blogging platform** built with:

- [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) (GraphQL API)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) (ORM & database access)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (type safety)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) (server integration)
- [graphql-ws](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws) (WebSocket subscriptions)

This project is designed to be a **training/learning project**, inspired by platforms like Medium.  
It supports authentication, user accounts, posts, comments, likes, and GraphQL subscriptions.
